SublimeLinter
=============

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)

The code linting framework for [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3).


## Upgrading from SublimeLinter 3

You can read about all the changes [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/master/messages/4.0.0.txt). If you're not ready for this, you can manually install the last [SL3 release](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/releases/tag/v3.10.10).

Perhaps most important are changes to settings.
Inline settings and .sublimelinterrc configurations files no longer work. 
If you need inline or per-directory overrides, most linters provide features for that. 
[Project settings](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/docs/settings.rst#project-settings) are still there though,
and you can use several [variables](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/docs/settings.rst#settings-expansion) in them now.

There is no longer a global ["python"](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/docs/linter_settings.rst#python) setting,
but it can be set per linter. 
Linters now also have ["executable"](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter/blob/master/docs/linter_settings.rst#executable) settings,
and styles can be customized per linter (and even per error code).
The default settings have a lot of documentation in them to help you tweak them. Also be sure to check the keybindings, they have several options too.
