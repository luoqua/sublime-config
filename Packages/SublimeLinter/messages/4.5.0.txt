SublimeLinter 4.5
=================

Sublime Text 3.1 has been released.

- Removed the detection of environment-readiness.
  Sublime Text 3.1 now loads the environment before telling plugins it's ready.
- Removed documentation about debugging env/path issues on macOS.

We noticed some users having an issue where a linter couldn't find "node" even
though "node" is in their $PATH. If you're having this problem you can remedy
it by patching the "env" for that linter in your settings like so:

"linters": {
    "eslint": {
        "env": {"PATH":"/usr/local/bin/"}
    }
}
