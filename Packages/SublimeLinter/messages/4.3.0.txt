SublimeLinter 4.3
=================

- Now shows the active/assigned linters in the status bar.
  SL will show e.g. 'eslint(ok)' if there were no errors, or 'eslint(1|2)' when
  there is 1 warning and 2 errors.
  If there is a hard error with the configuration it will state 'eslint(erred)'.
  The counters_template setting is still applied, but different than before.
  Check the default settings for more information.

- Introduces a new setting called 'kill_old_processes'. If set it to true,
  SL will send a 'terminate' signal to processes when SL won't use its output.
  Use this if you're using slow linters that seem to hang ST a lot.

- For OSX we now wait (up to 1 minute) until the env has been loaded by Sublime.
  This should prevent issues with SL not finding the executables.
  Note that dev builds of ST also fix this issue for us.

- Fixed a bug where hovering would sometimes not open the right tooltip.
- Fixed the visualization of multi-line errors in tooltips.
- Fixed a bug where not all gutter icons were drawn.

- The debounce delay before a lint in background mode will now be set
  automatically based on how fast your computer and your linters actually are.
- Added an upper limit for how many lint processes can run in parallel.
- Much improved logging about what command SL actually runs.


For plugin developers
----------------------

BREAKING CHANGES:
- For STREAM_BOTH linters we will call 'linter.on_stderr()' automatically if
  there is any output on 'stderr' and only pass 'stdout' down.
  Set 'on_stderr = None' to disable.
- Removed 'util.popen()'
- Removed 'linter.build_options()'

DEPRECATED:
- 'util.communicate' has been deprecated,
  The functionality is now in 'self._communicate'.
  If you need to quickly run a command, use 'util.check_output'

NEW:
- New API: popen calls now return an object, not just a string of the output
  with the typical members '.stdout/.stderr/returncode'.
  For compatibility, only the new 'linter.parse_output(proc, virtual_view)'
  actually sees this 'proc'.
- If the linter failed, call 'self.notify_failure()'.
  You should additionally log the error either as an error or a warning.
- In the 'defaults' setting we now support flags like "{'--stdin': True|False}".
  You can also define e.g. "{'--include': ''}" instead of "{'--include:': ''}".
- You can now get the linter settings via 'get_linter_settings(linter, view)'.
