SublimeLinter 4.0.1
======================

Introduces highlights.demote_scope

Did you see the settings "highlights.*"? We have a new one:

"highlights.demote_scope"

Set it to the empty string to actually hide regions while editing.
Set it to a scope to change their appearance, e.g. "comment" to draw
them in a soft color.
