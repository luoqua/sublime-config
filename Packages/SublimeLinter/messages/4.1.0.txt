SublimeLinter 4.1.0
===================

Introduces a setting to show the output panel if there are problems:

"show_panel_on_save"

- Set to "window" to check if the window has problems.
- Set to "view" to only check the current file.
- Set to "never" to disable this feature. This is the default


Also introduces a new command to quickly toggle highlights, which can be useful
if you're just reading or hacking on some pseudo code:

"SublimeLinter: Toggle Highlights"

You can create your own key binding for this if you like, using
"sublime_linter_toggle_highlights"


Deprecations:
- The panel can no longer be filtered. The filtering had several problems
  and not a lot of usage. We will need to rethink this feature if there
  does appear to be demand for it.
- Linter plugins can no longer set version requirements. More info in #1087.
