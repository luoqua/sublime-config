Sublime SVN 1.7.0 Changelog:

New Features

 - Subversion 1.8 support

 - "svn+ssh://" protocol support on Windows via custom Plink executable

 - New "svn_ssh_options" setting for controling authentication of
   "svn+ssh://" repositories

 - Support for repositories that have up to two folder paths before the
   logical root of the repository. This is the case when an SVN repository
   contains multiple projects, each with their own "/trunk", "/branches" and
   "/tags" structure. For instance, when the root of the SVN repository is
   "https://svn.example.com/", but a specific project is stored at 
   "https://svn.example.com/projects/myproject/trunk".

 - Added check to ensure the SVN package is not being improperly synced
   from OS X/Linux to Windows, and thus missing the Windows ".exe" files

 - Improved detection of encountering working copies created with a newer
   version of Subversion than is available to the user

 - Rearchitecture of Windows subprocess backend and custom Subversion and
   Plink binaries, resulting in less process spawning and improved
   interactive authentication


Bug Fixes

 - Fixed handling of file names with the "@" symbol in them

 - Added the "sublime_text_binary" setting to help with checking out a
   repository to a new folder on ST2

 - Fixed a bug with incorrectly detecting an unexpected error as a package
   upgrade event

 - Fixed a bug displaying log dates on Windows

 - Fixed an encoding issue when writing to log files in ST3

 - Corrected an issue with the "Ignore" and "Unignore" command on ST3

 - Improved capturing command output when an authentication prompt was
   displayed in the middle of an operation such as an Update

 - Changed forking of "svn" processes on posix platforms to unset the
   "DISPLAY" environmental variable to prevent the flash of an GUI SSH
   password prompt. Sublime SVN already proxies prompts to the Sublime
   Text interface.

 - Fixed a selection issue with pre-selecting the branch name when branching
   a repository that has a path prefix

 - Corrected a bug caching the SSH password for an "svn+ssh://" repository
   when not using SSH keys on ST3

 - Resolved an issue reading the debug settings when the package is first
   loaded by ST3

 - Fixed a bug with resolving a Tree Conflict on OS X resulting in an error
   message about running code in the main thread

 - Fixed an error with an unbound variable in "threads.py" during specific
   error conditions

 - Improved handling of unseen SSL certificates on Windows when being
   prompted for authentication information

 - Fixed a bug using an SVN working copy via a network share on Windows when
   the hostname contained characters other than letters and numbers
